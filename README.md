# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a fun and interactive game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game can be played in two modes: Single Player or Multiplayer.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against the computer and try to guess the number with limited chances.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Compete with a friend to see who can guess the number with the highest score.
- **Score Calculation**: Your score is calculated based on how quickly you guess the number. The earlier you guess, the higher your score!

## Instructions

1. Choose between Single Player or Multiplayer mode.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number.
3. You have 3 free chances to guess the number correctly. After that, your score will decrease based on the number of attempts.
4. The player who guesses the number correctly first (or with the highest score) wins!
